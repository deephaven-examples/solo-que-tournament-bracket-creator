# Solo Queue Team Game Tournament Bracket Creator

This repository contains content for creating evenly matched tournament brackets for team games in which all participating players solo queue.

## Structure

This repository is split up into a few different folders. The files in this base folder are used for starting up the application in Deephaven.

- `Python`: Contains the two Python scripts that can be used to create a tournament brack for teams.
- `Docs`: Contains further explanation of the math and other concepts required to understand the solutions.
- `data`: Contains a seeding CSV file that can be used to test out the scripts.

## Usage

This application is meant to be used to construct tournaments for team based games.
The brackets consist of teams that are mathematically evenly matched.
For guidance on how to use both of the scripts, refer to the file `/data/Usage.md`.
